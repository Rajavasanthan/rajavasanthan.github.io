# Art Without Emotion Is Just Noise — And That’s What AI Makes

## Who is an artist?

Is it just someone who draws with pencil and paper? No. An artist is someone who creates a stir in society through original thought. Pencil and paper are merely tools to express those thoughts. True artists are the ones who guide society in the right direction.

Imagine a pile of wood. Simply drawing it realistically on paper doesn’t make someone an artist. But the person who makes us realize that those pieces of wood were once a beautiful tree — *that* is an artist. It's not just about realism; it's about evoking realization, emotion, and reflection.

## Why am I writing this now?

I know I’m late to the whole Ghibli art conversation that trended online a few weeks ago. I was quietly observing all the debates and perspectives. Some said “Art is dead.” Others argued it’s a privacy issue to upload your photo to ChatGPT. Some even claimed that OpenAI should pay royalties to Studio Ghibli.
But amidst all this noise, we must not forget — art is not about tools or technology. It’s about vision. It’s about perspective. And most importantly, it’s about the message.

## AI can never replace the artist.

If you believe that AI will replace artists, then maybe it’s time to rethink your definition of who an artist truly is. I'm not just talking about painters. I’m talking about anyone who creates a ripple in society through their craft — be it dance, music, sculpture, film, documentaries — *everything* that inspires and questions is art.

# DALL·E?

I’m not talking about the AI image generation model. I’m talking about the legendary artist who lived between 1904 and 1989 — Salvador Dalí. Take his iconic work, *The Persistence of Memory*. Even today, people discuss its meaning, its symbolism, its take on the fluidity of time. That painting doesn’t just show time — it *questions* it. That’s art.

AI can replicate that painting or create something similar. But it can’t replicate Dalí’s *mind*, his *thoughts*, or the *why* behind the brushstrokes.

**That’s the difference. That’s what makes someone an artist.**

# Michael Jackson: The Artist, Not Just the Performer

Most of us see dance as just entertainment. But can dance be a tool to fight for peace and unity in this world? *Yes.* The King of Pop, **Michael Jackson**, did exactly that through his art. His albums were never just dance records. They were powerful messages wrapped in rhythm and movement. Millions became die-hard fans — not just for his voice or his iconic moves, but because he stood for something bigger.As an artist, he carried a deep responsibility — and he used his art to communicate, to awaken, and to challenge the world.

Let’s take just one of his many impactful songs: **“They Don’t Care About Us.”**
When I first heard this track in the early 2000s, I was drawn in by the fast beats and the drum rolls. I didn’t know who MJ was. I didn’t understand the lyrics. I just liked the sound — and that was enough for me back then.

Years later, as I learned more about Michael Jackson — his style, his message, his global influence — I listened to the same song again. This time, I noticed more: the choreography, the intensity, the locations where it was filmed. Still later, after reading about the history of racial discrimination, especially between Black and White communities, I came back to the song once more.

And suddenly, *everything* changed.
The same song that once felt energetic and catchy now felt heavy, raw, and real. It was no longer just a peppy pop song. It was the *pain* of an entire community. It was a cry for justice. A voice for the unheard.

Michael Jackson poured layers of meaning into his art. Every beat, every step, every word in that song carried a message. And the fact that he, a Black man who visibly transformed into looking white, chose to sing about racial injustice — that made it even more powerful. It was personal. It was political. It was *art* in its truest form.

To anyone reading this, I urge you: read Michael Jackson’s biography — from his childhood to his final days — and then revisit “They Don’t Care About Us.” I promise, your entire perspective on the song, and maybe even the world, will shift.

**That’s the power of an artist.**

AI can create a video that looks like Michael Jackson. It can generate an image of him. But it *cannot* recreate his pain.It cannot replicate his soul. It cannot carry the emotional weight of his voice, his message, or his purpose.

Art may be replicable. But **the artist is not.**

# Spirited Away – A Wonderful Piece of Art

When Studio Ghibli’s art style became popular on social media recently, everyone was talking about how “Art is dead” and how AI is replacing artists. I was curious — *is that really true?* Is it really that easy for AI to replicate true art? To find out for myself, I decided to watch a movie made by Studio Ghibli — **Spirited Away**.

And oh man, AI is nowhere even close. The amount of detail in that film is extraordinary. And I’m not just talking about the technical details. The emotions captured in the movie touch the soul of the audience.

The main character, Sen, is a young girl who loses her parents in a magical world. The story follows her journey to save them. Throughout her journey, she confronts her fears, learns to make brave and wise decisions, and meets both good and bad characters along the way.

As you watch, you cry when Sen cries. You’re amazed by the magical world and the beautiful music. The movie is a *complete piece of art* — carefully crafted to convey deep emotions and life lessons.

How could something like this ever be replaced by AI?

Sure, for the sake of argument, today’s AI, like ChatGPT paired with image generators, can create art *in the style* of Ghibli. But what are people really doing with it?
They're uploading selfies, photos with loved ones, and converting them into "Ghibli-style" images.

Is that truly *art*?

And now, just a week later, the internet has already moved on to something else.
Is this a healthy way to treat art and creativity? *Never.*
Art is not just about a style or an image. It’s about the story, the emotions, the effort, and the vision behind it.

People who believe AI will replace art need to *rethink* what art truly is.
